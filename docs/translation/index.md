# Localization and language

Just like JupyterLab, JupyterLite provides the ability to set the
[display language](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/language.html) of
the user interface.

## Language Packs

To be able to provide a new display language, you will need to install a language pack.

Visit the [language packs repository](https://github.com/jupyterlab/language-packs) for
a list of available packs.

## Installing

JupyterLite follows the same installation procedure as in JupyterLab. Please refer to
the JupyterLab documentation to learn more on
[installing new language packs](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/language.html#installing).

## Changing the display language

The steps to change the display language from the user interface are the same as for
JupyterLab:

All of the core JupyterLite [apps](../applications/index.md) support localization:
