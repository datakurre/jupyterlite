    """Install the given package and all of its dependencies.
    See :ref:`loading packages <loading_packages>` for more information.
    This only works for packages that are either pure Python or for packages
    with C extensions that are built in Pyodide. If a pure Python package is not
    found in the Pyodide repository it will be loaded from one of
    `indexURL <globalThis.pipliteUrls>` or PyPI, if enabled.

    Parameters
    ----------
    requirements : ``str | List[str]``
        A requirement or list of requirements to install. Each requirement is a
        string, which should be either a package name or URL to a wheel:
        - If the requirement ends in ``.whl`` it will be interpreted as a URL.
          The file must be a wheel named in compliance with the
          `PEP 427 naming convention <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427/#file-format>`_.
        - If the requirement does not end in ``.whl``, it will interpreted as the
          name of a package. A package by this name must either be present in the
          Pyodide repository at `indexURL <globalThis.loadPyodide>` or on PyPi

    keep_going : ``bool``, default: False
        This parameter decides the behavior of the micropip when it encounters a
        Python package without a pure Python wheel while doing dependency
        resolution:
        - If ``False``, an error will be raised on first package with a missing wheel.
        - If ``True``, the micropip will keep going after the first error, and report a list
          of errors at the end.

    Returns
    -------
    ``Future``
        A ``Future`` that resolves to ``None`` when all packages have been
        downloaded and installed.
